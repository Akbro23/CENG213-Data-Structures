# CENG-213-Data-Structures

These are my implementations of the programming assignments for data structures course at METU using C++. 

## Short description
- **Programming assignment 1**: implementation of a browser with tabs using circular doubly linked list 
- **Programming assignment 2**: implementation of a treemap data structure using scapegoat tree to store key-value pairs
- **Programming assignment 3**: implementation of graph coloring algorithms to color 3D objects


## Topics

- **Programming assignment 1**: Linked List, Circular Doubly Linked List
- **Programming assignment 2**: Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees, Scapegoat Trees, TreeMap 
- **Programming assignment 3**: Graphs, Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm, Breadth-First Search, Binary Heap
